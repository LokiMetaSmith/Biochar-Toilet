This is an excellent engineering choice for your application. You are describing the **"Inside-Fitting"** or **"Oval Manway"** design, most famously popularized by the **Hawkins** brand of pressure cookers in India.

This design solves your two biggest problems: **thread fouling** (bentonite dust destroys threads) and **mechanical complexity** (clamps/bolts require extra parts).

Here is how to adapt this cookware concept into a rugged industrial sanitation device.

### 1. Why this works for "Severe Service" (Dust + Pressure)

The genius of the oval lid is that the **lid itself is physically larger than the hole** along one axis.

* **Blowout Proof:** In a standard "outside" lid, if the bolts fail, the lid becomes a projectile. In this "inside" design, the pressure pushes the lid *against* the metal rim of the chamber. It is mechanically impossible for the lid to blow off while pressurized.
* **Foul-Resistant:** Because there are no threads, there are no small crevices for your bentonite/magnetite dust to pack into. If dust gets on the rim, the massive force of the internal pressure (the "self-energizing" effect) will simply crush the gasket over the dust, maintaining the seal.

### 2. The Geometry: How to Manufacture It

You do not need complex castings. You can manufacture this using standard stainless steel plate.

* **The Shape:** Both the chamber opening and the lid are **Ellipses** (ovals).
* *Example:* If your opening is 6 inches wide (minor axis) and 7 inches long (major axis), your lid would be 6.5 inches wide and 7.5 inches long.


* **The Insertion Motion:** To insert the lid, you turn it 90 degrees so the lid's *short* side fits through the hole's *long* side. Once inside, you rotate it back 90 degrees and pull it up.
* **Material:** 316 Stainless Steel is ideal for urine/corrosion resistance.

### 3. Adapting for Automation (The "Internal Hinge")

The only downside of the Indian cooker design is that it requires a complex human hand motion (insert, twist, rotate, pull). To make this "mechanically simple" for a device that might be automated or operated easily by a user:

**Add a Single Internal Hinge.**
Instead of a loose lid, attach the oval lid to a hinge *inside* the vessel.

* **Operation:** When the user (or actuator) pushes a lever, the lid swings down and "collapses" slightly into the chamber.
* **Closing:** A spring pulls the lid back up against the hole.
* **Benefit:** This keeps the lid aligned perfectly every time. The user doesn't have to fiddle with the geometric puzzle of fitting the oval through the hole; the hinge guides it.

### 4. The Seal Interface (Combining your ideas)

To make this work with your "high compliance" idea:

1. **The Gasket:** Place a thick, soft **Silicone or EPDM gasket** around the *top rim* of the oval lid.
2. **The Seat:** The rim of the chamber opening should be smooth.
3. **The "Pre-Tension":** You mentioned a "partial seal." In the Indian cooker, a handle clips onto a bar to pull the lid up gently. For your device, use a **Simple Cam Lever**.
* *Step 1:* User drops lid in.
* *Step 2:* User pulls a small lever that pulls the lid up with ~5 lbs of force. This squishes the soft gasket just enough to make it airtight.
* *Step 3:* Induction starts -> Pressure builds -> Lid seals with 1000+ lbs of force.



### 5. Specific Caution: Induction Heating

You mentioned using induction coils.

* **Risk:** If your induction coils are wrapped around the *outside* of the stainless steel chamber near the lid, the **lid itself might heat up** via induction, potentially melting your gasket.
* **Solution:** Ensure your induction coils are focused lower down on the magnetite payload, or use a non-conductive ceramic/composite spacer ring between the heated zone and the steel sealing rim.

### Summary

Yes, steal this design. It is the most robust, fail-safe, and foul-resistant pressure vessel design available.

* **Action:** Design an elliptical opening.
* **Seal:** Top-mounted gasket on the lid.
* **Mechanism:** "Drop, Twist, Pull" (manual) or "Internal Hinge" (semi-auto).
