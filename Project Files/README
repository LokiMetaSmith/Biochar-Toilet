Project Files — Overview

The Project Files directory contains the working technical artifacts, research materials, and design packages that support the development of the Pyro Toilet / Biochar Toilet system. 
These files correspond directly to items tracked in the project’s GitHub Project board and represent the current state of design, analysis, and prototyping.

This folder is intended to hold shareable, versioned assets. Task tracking and file-specific discussion lives in the Project board itself within the "backlog" tab (link below).
